NAME
----
fbcompose - A compositing addon for fluxbox window manager.

SYNOPSIS
--------
*fbcompose* [options]

*fbcompose* [-h | --help] |
            [-V | --version]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*fbcompose(1)* is an optional compositing addon for fluxbox window manager. It
augments fluxbox with a number of graphical features. Most notably, fbcompose
allows fluxbox to properly display applications that require compositing
(docky, for example), adds support for true window transparency (as opposed to
fluxbox's pseudo transparency) and provides a plugin framework to extend the
compositor's functionality.

Rendering modes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
fbcompose supports three different rendering backends, which are specified as
the rendering mode:

*opengl*::
    The OpenGL backend. It uses OpenGL and GLX to render the the screens'
    contents. It is the most resource intensive of the backends, but it
    provides the smoothest experience.
*xrender*::
    The XRender backend. It uses X server's XRender extension to render the
    screens' contents. It is more reliable and less resource intensive compared
    to OpenGL backend, but its performance may sometimes drop.
*serverauto*::
    Lets the X server take care of compositing. Unlike other backends, this
    backend does not provide any graphical improvements or plugins, but it
    allows fluxbox to correctly render applications that require compositing.
    It is the least resource intensive mode.

Note that not all of them may be available, depending on how the fluxbox
package has been compiled. Running +fbcompose --help+ will list the available
rendering modes.

OPTIONS
-------
*-d* 'display', *--display* 'display'::
    Use the specified display connection.

*-h*, *--help*::
    Print the help text and exit.

*-m* 'mode', *--mode* 'mode'::
    Use the specified rendering mode.

*--no-x-errors*::
    Do not print any X errors.

*-p* 'plugin', *--plugin* 'plugin'::
    Load and use the specified plugin.

*-q*, *--quiet*::
    Do not print anything.

*-r* 'rate', *--refresh-rate* 'rate'::
    Specify the target refresh rate in Hz.

*--sync*::
    Synchronize the connection with the X server. Useful for debugging.

*-v*, *--verbose*::
    Print more information. Pass several times for more output.

*-V*, *--version*::
    Print the version text and exit.

PLUGINS
-------
Plugins provide fbcompose with extra functionality. They may change the way
windows are presented to the user or add various effects to the desktop. To use
plugins, just start fbcompose with the appropriate --plugin options.

At the moment of writing, the plugins cannot be configured yet.

Plugins, Included With fbcompose
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
fbcompose comes bundled with two plugins.

*fade*::
    The fade plugin adds fade animations to windows as they are being mapped
    and unmapped.
*preview*::
    The preview plugin adds a window preview thumbnail, which appears whenever
    the user hovers over the window buttons in the iconbar.

Installing New Plugins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Note that plugins for OpenGL and XRender backends are different: a single
plugin can only work with one of these backends.

To install an OpenGL plugin, copy the .so file into
\~/.fluxbox/fbcompose/plugins/opengl directory.

To install an XRender plugin, copy the .so file into
\~/.fluxbox/fbcompose/plugins/xrender directory.

Writing Plugins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
TODO

EXAMPLES
--------
+fbcompose+::
    Run the compositor using the default renderer, settings and no plugins.  

+fbcompose -m xrender+::
    Run the compositor in XRender mode.

+fbcompose -m opengl -p fade -p preview+::
    Run the compositor in OpenGL mode and use both fade and preview plugins.

KNOWN BUGS
----------
- The OpenGL backend does not seem to work on computers with nvidia video cards
  that have two monitors. At the moment the only workaround is to use XRender
  mode.

BUGS
----
As this is still a beta version of the compositor, the bugs are likely. If you
find any, please visit the #fluxbox irc channel on irc.freenode.net or submit
them to the bug tracker at http://sf.net/projects/fluxbox . Or you may
subscribe to one of the mailing lists. More information can be found on the
official website at http://www.fluxbox.org .
